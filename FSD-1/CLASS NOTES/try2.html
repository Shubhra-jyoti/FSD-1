          Goa attracts a significant influx of both international and domestic
          tourists annually due to its white-sand beaches, active nightlife,
          religious landmarks, and UNESCO World Heritage-listed architecture. It
          also boasts rich biodiversity, lying near the Western Ghats, a
          biodiversity hotspot. The North Goa district draws more visitors owing
          to its numerous restaurants, accommodation options, and a vibrant
          nightlife. In contrast, South Goa is noted for its serene beaches and
          luxury resorts, catering primarily to high-end tourists seeking
          privacy and tranquility

          <div id="manali">
            Manali is the beginning of an ancient trade route through Lahaul
            (H.P.) and Ladakh, over the Karakoram Pass and onto Yarkand and
            Hotan in the Tarim Basin of China. As per the 2011 Census of India,
            the Manali Municipal Council had a population of 8,096, comprising
            4,717 males and 3,379 females. Updated estimates suggest the town's
            population is approximately 11,700 as of 2025. During the summer
            2025 monsoon season, heavy rainfall triggered multiple landslides in
            Mandi district, disrupting the Chandigarh Manali highway near 4
            Mile, Pandoh, and the Thalot Tunnel. The route was blocked for up to
            24 hours, stranding hundreds of vehicles and causing significant
            travel delays. Statewide, over 400 roads were blocked; Mandi alone
            reported 232 blocked roads and 71 in the Kullu district, including
            Manali-bound routes. The disasters resulted in 137 deaths, with
            severe damage to roads, water and power infrastructure. Due to the
            narrow Himalayan terrain and recent landslides, traffic congestion
            along the ChandigarhManali National Highway (NH21) has worsened
            significantly. Even outside disaster periods, gridlock is common
            during peak tourist season, leading to long delays and often only
            one-way traffic management on affected stretches
